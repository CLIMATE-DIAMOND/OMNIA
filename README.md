# OMNIA
This repository contains the OMNIA model, OMNIA model, an open-source, global energy system model covering energy systems dynamics for 28 regions. The model development has been developed under the Horizon-DIAMOND project.

This folder contains the model, data files and associated scripts that are used for setting up OMNIA model. please refer to the individual folders for the respective contents.
This is a work in Progress. The first release will be ready by July 2025 and the final version by July 2026.

OMNIA has been developed by E4SMA S.r.l., ESMIA Consultant, Imperial College London (IMPERIAL), University College London (UCL), CICERO  under the framework of the Diamond EU Project (elivering the next generation of open Integrated Assessment MOdels for Net-zero, sustainable Development) funded by the European Union. 

The OMNIA model integrates and expands the open-source TIMES-GEO model developed by University College Cork and E4SMA in the context of the CHIMERA project.

# Climate policy use
This model has been built to better inform increased global mitigation ambition by significantly increasing TIMES-GEO sectoral and technological detail, spatial and temporal resolution, robustness, and capacity to represent structural changes, extremes, and behavioural changes
